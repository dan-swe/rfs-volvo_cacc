By default, gpsinsert operates on path_gps.db, use -d flag to change.
 
To run gpsinsert, first delete or copy out the old path_gps.db, then
pipe a GPS NEMA stream to it; -t flag prints timing at end, -v is very
verbose for debugging.

# cat </dev/ttyUSB0 | gpsinsert -t & 

or on a system with gpsd, you can use tcp_client from sens/gps/examples
to get a raw NEMA stream.

# tcpclient -t -q r | gpsinsert -t & 

While it is running or after killed, can use

# sqlite3 path_gps.db

to examine the tables (see creation in gps.dump).
