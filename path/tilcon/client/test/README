The script obm_test.sh  and sample.sh are guides for running the programs.
Start  obm_test or sample in another window.

The programs stop.sh and stop_obm.sh are supposed to kill all three 
processes, but sometimes the Tilcon processes refuse to die and have to
be killed as root or killed with -9 by process id.

When processes die unexpectedly (without doing a proper clt_logut) you
may need to run db_clean.sh to get the data bucket operating correctly again.

Note that if db_clean.sh is run when processes have executed cleanly, you
may get a usage message from ipcrm, but this doesn't mean anything is wrong.
