On my dell laptop which I'll leave up and running with linux,  
128.32.234.243, username PATH, pwd pathavcs, there's a directory in  
the home called Installers.  If you want to install Tilcon on your  
local machine, grab the files:

550G-GM-TSP-RHLE4-X86-002.bin
licensex.til
tilcon_help55.tgz

The interface developer is locked to run only on my laptop, but that  
TSP package can be installed on any machine to allow runtime apps and  
compiling.  I'll assume that you just copy the licensex.til file into  
what ever directory the .bin creates.

I don't know if the new tilcon help files will come with the TSP  
install.  If not, I've tar'ed them up and provided you with a .tgz  
file.  All of the help is webpage based, so just unpack the .tgz and  
open up the help files with your browser.

Finally, if you want, tomorrow I can ask Jonathan how to enable  
remote desktop sharing or vnc or something like that on the linux  
laptop.  You might be able to remotely and graphically log into the  
linux laptop to use the Tilcon developer if you need to.  I know  
there are options and ways, but I just don't have a clue how.  Let me  
know if you want that.
