This directory hold programs and scripts to make plotting easier.

SHELL SCRIPTS

fixtime.sh converts a file $base.dat with first column hr:min:sec.milli
timestamp to a file $base.plt that has a first column in seconds since midnight

fixradar.sh does the same thing for a file with first two columns as
hr:min:sec.milli timestamps. 

fixutc.sh takes an xfile already processed by fixtime.sh and converts
the utc timestamp in column 37 to seconds since midnight (Greenwich)

fixgga.sh takes a file in GPS NEMA format containing GGA lines and produces
a 3-column output, utc, lat, long.

fixgpslog.sh takes the current log of the gpsread process and puts it
in pseudo-NEMA GGA format for processing by fixgga.sh 

The .plt files are easier to plot in gnuplot, matlab or excel.

C PROGRAMS

The C programs can all be build with default make.

create_ml takes as input a file with variable names and column numbers
and produces a .m file for loading a .dat file into matlab.

create_pl takes as input a file with variable names and column numbers
and produces a set of gnuplot macros that when loaded into gnuplot
will create multiplots of the variables in file "test.dat"

COLUMN DESCRIPTION FILES

radar.in and xfile.in are sample input files to create_ml and create_pl
that contain all the columns in the CICAS [ab]*.dat and x*.dat files,
respectively; radbg.in is a selection of fields for debuggin that
show the radar targets 1 and 2, which are most likely to be active with
the EVT 300 radars.

Use these as standard input, e.g.,

create_pl <radar.in >radar.out

Then convert the radar file you are interested in and rename it test.dat:
fixradar.sh a1121036.dat
cp a1121036.plt test.dat

Then
gnuplot
> l 'radar.out'

to do the plots
 
SAMPLE GNUPLOT MACROS

The file "gps.gpl" can be loaded for a latitude/longitude plot of GPS
data; it has examples of setting ranges in gnuplot and using an abscissa
other than the default line number (which in our usage corresponds to
"ticks" or time samples); 'gpspos.gpl' is the same except the longitude
range is positive, so can be used for data taken directly from GPS NEMA
traces without converting to negative.
