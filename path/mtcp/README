= MTCP and Sockhop

== MTCP

MTCP is a library for sending and receiving datagrams over a stream socket (e.g., TCP or UNIX) using a very simple protocol.

The Makefile handles build, test and documentation tasks. Briefly:

make      -- build everything
make test -- build everything and run tests
make docs -- build docs indexed in doc/html/index.html

See the docs (or mtcp.h) for details.

MTCP has worked on windows, but test_mtcp will not (it uses fork).

== Sockhop

Sockhop is a socket client/server protocol for publish/subscribe IPC. The sockhop protocol is based on mtcp:

- to subscribe, send the topic as a message, then receive data messages

- to publish, send the topic, then send data messages

- to read the last value, send the topic, receive a data message, and repeat

Rather than use mtcp driectly, it is easier to use the interface defined in sockhop-client.h. See the sample/ dir for sample clients for the above uses. The server is currently implemented in ruby--see the sockhop package.
