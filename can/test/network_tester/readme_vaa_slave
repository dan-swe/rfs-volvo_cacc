This file contains basic usage information for vaa_slave and the low-level network test scripts that it calls. Information here is primarily applicable to the two vaa machines, running the Steinhoff drivers. 

direct usage refers to execution of a script on a VAA machine. 
remote usage refers to transmission of a TCP message to vaa_slave.sh. 

TRANSMIT - can_tx - transmit data across the CAN network
direct usage: can_tx -p [port] -e 1 -t [time] -n [number] -i [identifier]
remote usage: SEND [port] [time] [number] [identifier]
[port] - 1 or 2
[time] - transmission interval (seconds)
[number] - how many messages to send
[identifier] - message identifier, not critical for testing purposes

RECEIVE - can_rx - receive data from the CAN network and retransmit using nc
direct usage: can_rx -p [port]
remote usage: SEND [port] [ip] [TCP]
[port] - 1 or 2 (CAN port #)
[ip] - data will be sent back to this ip
[TCP] - data will be sent back to this TCP port

START - slay -f -Q can_dual , start_can_dual - restarts the drivers
direct usage: start_can_dual [bits]
remote usage: START [baud]
[bits] - timing bits to implement the baud rate
[baud] - baud rate
