This directory contains device level programming for the Phillips SJA1000
CAN controller..

Usage:
read_can_mm 0xd0000 0
will read the mode register (offset 0) of a board at memory address 0xD0000
(default for Janus board, CAN port A; use 0xD0200)for CAN port B) 

read_can_mm 0xd0000 6   reads Bus Timing Register 0 (BTR0)
read_can_mm 0xd0000 7   reads Bus Timing Register 1 (BTR0)

To set CAN bus timing to 500Kb/s on CAN port A:
write_can_mm 0xd0000 6 0x01
write_can_mm 0xd0000 7 0x1C

To set CAN bus timing to 250Kb/s on CAN port B:
write_can_mm 0xd0000 6 0x41
write_can_mm 0xd0000 7 0x1C

Note that the CAN channel must be in the "bus off" state before
setting BTR0 and BTR1.

The sja1000funcs.c file came from can4linux3.5.4 (see the doc directory
for a copy of the distribution). Do a diff to see what changes were made.
Our driver relies primarily on the CANin facility from sja1000funcs.c
