clt_vars.h and vehicle.h have been removed from std_jbus.h, since
they are project specific, and were needed only by jbussend.c.

jbussend.h and previous versions of vehicle.h (veh_bus.h, veh_iost.h)
and clt_vars.h remain as documentation as what was done for Demo 2003.
veh_bus.h is still used by laipdu.c.
