rdj1939 doesn't read from the database, it writes to the database in normal
operation, after figuring out what kind of J1939 message it is, so that other
processes can get the formatted data.  If you give the -g and the -v flags,
this code in rdj1939.c
                if (generic) {
                        write_pgn_to_database(stdout, pgn, &pdu, pclt,
                                j1939_debug);
                        continue;
                }
will cause write_pgn_to_database (in j1939db.c) to call print_pdu through 
the function pointer in db_ref[0]  that is referenced in the code
        if (debug)
        // print variable information
                info->print_dbv((void *) buf, fp, 1);

if print_pdu (in j1939pdu.c) doesn't have exactly the format you need, either
filter it using awk/sed/grep to get the same format as the truck files (that
may have been  what was done before, John may remember, the data gathering
from the truck was done by a student from China who is no longer at PATH),
change print_pdu, or change sndpdu, whatever seems most convenient. Check
with John to see if it matters to him, but the truck work is well past
the early data gathering and simulation phase where gathering raw CAN bus
data is important.
