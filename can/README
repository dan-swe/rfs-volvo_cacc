This driver for the SSV CAN board was extensively rewritten for QNX6 based
on the QNX4 driver PATH contracted out Jorge M. Estrela da Silva and his
group at ISEP, Porto, Portugal in 2002.

It has been rewritten to use the QNX6 built-in resource manager facilities
for device control and open context blocks, to use pulses instead of proxies,
and to eliminate any C++ syntax.

It has also been modified to use native QNX6 message passing instead of the 
Cogent database.
