The can4linux directory contains the code base used in the can/drv_sja1000
directory to port the Linux driver for this chipset to QNX6. Unpack
the .tgz file and diff the sja1000.[ch] files in the can4linux-3.5.4
directory with those in the can/drv_sja1000 directory to see what changes
were made to the Linux Phillips SJA1000 specific code.
